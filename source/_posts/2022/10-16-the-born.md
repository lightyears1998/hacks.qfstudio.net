It is not easy for me to build up a technical blog, especially when I know little about web development technologies. That's why I pick up Hexo, which is a trendy static site-generating tool. I have seen many blogs using Hexo, including some of my friends' blogs. All the above have proved that Hexo is the right tool for making blogs.

Hexo comes with a built-in theme named Landscape. There are also many lovely themes available on the Hexo showcase. I could use one of those themes, but since I keep telling myself that I want to polish my skills in building websites, why not make a brand-new theme myself? Let's do it.

The very first step is to find some existing blogging websites for reference.
