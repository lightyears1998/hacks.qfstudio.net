I used to write my blog about my daily life using a self-hosted WordPress. Years ago I wanted to make a new blog about techs, and today I finally make up my mind onto it.

## Step 0: Make up My Mind

It is not easy for me to build up a technical blog, especially when I know little about web development technologies. Instead of building my blog from scratch, I decide to pick up a blogging tool. And I eventually pick up Hexo, which is a trendy static site-generating tool. I have seen many blogs using Hexo, including some of my friends' blogs. Time have proved that Hexo can be the right tool for making blogs.

When one use Hexo, they writes their blog post in Markdown format and Hexo converts the markdown files to HTML blog posts. Most of the tedious jobs are handled by Hexo.

In Hexo, the *theme* defines the appearance of the website and blog posts. Hexo comes with a built-in theme named Landscape. There are also many lovely themes available on the Hexo showcase. I could use one of those themes, but since I keep telling myself that I want to polish my skills in building websites, why not make a brand-new theme myself? Let's do it.

## Step 1: Pick up a Font

Let's pick the correct fonts for our website first. Despite my mother tongue is Mandarin Chinese, I decide to write my posts in English only to share my ideas with more readers. Chinese fonts are a bit headache: they usually heavier then latin fonts in file size. As the main language for the blog is English, I believe that using latin fonts are just enough, at least for now.

I am always fond of using free-and-open-source fonts. But where to find them? Not to kidding, but I find the [modding wiki page of Crusader King III](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Fonts) quite useful. The page says that one can find fantastic fonts on Font Squirrel, Cool Text, Vic Fieger's Website and Google Fonts. Let' navigate to these sites and dig out our treasure fonts. (Don't forget to set the license filter.)

I am going to pick up a title font, a text font and a monospace font for displaying code snippet in the future. After some hours of digging, I still won't be able to decide which fonts to pick up: There are just *too many* fonts available, and I'm a bit selective. Aha, lets' just keep it simple for now. Open Sans font family, that's the choice.

## Step 2: Make a Simple Layout

About the website layout, I would like to find some existing blogging websites/themes for reference. Follow [the guide](https://hexo.io/docs/themes) on Hexo document, I make a basic theme.

## Step 3: Name it

After finishing the very basic layout, I want to give the theme a beautiful name. *Alisha* comes to my mind. It is the character name from my favorite role-play game/anime *Tales of Zestiria*. And the blog is named *Lightyears Traveler*, which is inspired by the name of the PRG *Octopath Traveler* published by Square Enix.

I deploy the blog and theme on GitHub Actions, and it is done for now. I admit that it is a really simple theme, but it is the start, after all years hanging.

I'm quite busy at school routines now. Let's hope that I can spare some time in the near future to make some improvements on the theme. See you next time.
